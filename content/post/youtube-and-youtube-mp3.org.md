Youtube limits the external Tools, so you can&#39;t convert/download all the videos,
you would like to. I can imagine why Youtube has to do so, but its against **Freedom** isn&#39;t it?

Please vote [here](http://www.change.org/petitions/youtube-googlede-allow-third-party-recording-tools-for-youtube-freedomonyoutube#) if you think as i do, help the great people at Youtube to give us more Freedom.
